# Given a string s which consists of lowercase English letters. Removing duplicates means choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

# We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.(Answer is proven as unique)

# Input Format
# First Parameter - String s

# Output Format
# Return the string

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abbaca"
# Output: "ca"
# Explanation: From the "abbaca" remove bb then the result is aaca then 
# again remove aa which makes the remaing string as "ca".

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "azxxzy"
# Output: "ay"

# Constraints:
# 1 <= s.length <= 105
# s consists of lowercase English letters.
# Time complexity: O(n)
# Auxillary space complexity: O(n)
# 12
